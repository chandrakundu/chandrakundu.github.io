Even if you provide a baseURL for a remote host, it will run locally. Generate the Static Website: Create a folder named public. Run hugo -t to generate the static website, which will be stored in the public folder.

In my journey as a data aficionado, I see data not merely as numbers and graphs, but as a canvas for crafting compelling narratives that unveil valuable insights and address real-world problems. Think of it as a magical show where data takes center stage, and we’re the magicians pulling the strings. As a data magician, my magic wand comprises trusty programming languages — Python, R, and Matlab — that empower me to summon and manipulate the mystical essence of data. Much like an alchemist delicately crafts their elixir, I handle data with precision and care, knowing that with the right blend of algorithms and techniques, it can be transformed into something truly valuable. Yet, the true magic doesn’t just in the tools, but in the storytelling. I excel in narrating compelling tales through intuitive and engaging visualizations. Every chart, every graph, whispers a story of opportunities and strategies. As an instructor of record at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the University of Central Florida and a PhD candidate in Big Data analytics, I am passionate about sharing my love of data and storytelling with others. I guide students on their own alchemical journeys, teaching them the art of data transformation, the impact of visualization, and the wisdom of insightful storytelling.
